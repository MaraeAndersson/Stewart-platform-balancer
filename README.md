# Stewart platform balancer (WIP)
By Martin Andersson and Oliver Moberg

## Description
The stewart-platform-balancer is a 3 Degrees Of Freedom (DOF) stewart platform made with the intention to further our knowledge about control systems, computer vision and filtering. The goal of the project is to have the platform manage to balance a ping pong ball on the platform by using a Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) to control the three servos controling the orientation of the platform.
 
 To determine the x and y position of the ball a camera was used in combination with a raspberry pi 3 and openCV2
